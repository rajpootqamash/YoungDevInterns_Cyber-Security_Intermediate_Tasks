# 🔐 Cybersecurity Tasks Repository

Welcome to the **Cybersecurity Tasks Repository**, a hands-on documentation project designed to explore core cybersecurity concepts using real-world tools and practices. This project is ideal for beginners, students, or anyone looking to enhance their practical skills in network security and account protection.


## 📌 Objective

This repository contains step-by-step walkthroughs for three essential cybersecurity tasks:

1. **Vulnerability Scanning** – Discover open ports and potential weaknesses in a network using Nmap or OpenVAS.
2. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** – Enhance security of online accounts using two-step verification.
3. **Network Traffic Analysis** – Capture and analyze live network packets using Wireshark to understand protocols and potential threats.

Each task demonstrates:
- Tool setup and configuration
- Hands-on execution
- Analysis and interpretation of results
- Screenshots for validation


## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

  - Nmap – For scanning networks and identifying open ports.

  - OpenVAS (optional) – For in-depth vulnerability scanning and risk assessment.

  - Google Authenticator / Authy – For generating time-based 2FA codes.

  - Wireshark – For capturing and analyzing live network traffic.


## 🧪 Tasks Overview

### ✅ Task 1: Perform a Basic Vulnerability Scan
- Identify open ports, running services, and potential vulnerabilities using `nmap`.
- Optional: Use `OpenVAS` for deeper vulnerability scanning.
- Learn how to interpret scan outputs and recognize weak spots in a system.

### ✅ Task 2: Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- Understand the importance of multi-layered security.
- Enable 2FA on personal services like Gmail, Facebook, GitHub.
- Use mobile authenticator apps or backup codes for secure access.


### ✅ Task 3: Analyze Network Traffic
- Capture network packets using Wireshark.
- Analyze protocols such as HTTP, TCP, DNS, and ICMP.
- Identify suspicious traffic patterns and extract useful information from raw packets.


## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, you will:

- Understand how to perform basic ethical hacking and vulnerability discovery.
- Learn to strengthen account security through multi-factor authentication.
- Gain insight into how data flows through networks and how malicious actors exploit it.
- Improve your ability to use industry-standard cybersecurity tools.
