# 🛡️ Task 1: Perform a Basic Vulnerability Scan

## 🎯 Purpose
The goal of this task is to perform a basic vulnerability scan on a system using Nmap, a powerful and widely used network scanning tool. By conducting these scans, we can identify open ports, discover running services, detect service versions, and gather information that could help assess potential vulnerabilities in a system.


## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Nmap** – An open-source network scanner used to discover hosts and services on a computer network.
- **Linux Terminal (Parrot Linux)** – Command-line interface to run Nmap commands.
- *(Optional)* OpenVAS – For deeper vulnerability analysis (not covered in this guide).


## 🪜 Step-by-Step Procedure

### ✅ Step 1: Open Terminal
Open your Linux terminal  where we will execute all commands.

### ✅ Step 2: Check if Nmap is Installed

- sudo apt update
- sudo apt install nmap

✅ Step 3: Perform a Basic Localhost Scan
    Use the following command to scan your own machine:

           nmap <target_ip>
![scan ip](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/261f9fcb-dddb-4dad-a77e-635d7d884c45)

✅ Step 4: Detect Running Services and Versions
    To find out which services are running and their versions, use:

           nmap -sV -O <target_ip>

✅ Step 5: Scan All Ports on a Target Machine
     You can scan all 65,535 ports with:
    
              nmap -p- -sV 192.168.1.10
             
Replace 192.168.1.10 with your actual target IP (if applicable).

✅ Step 6: Run an Aggressive Scan with OS Detection
       Use aggressive scan mode to gather more system information:

              nmap -A 127.0.0.1
## This includes:

  - OS detection

  - Version detection

   - Script scanning

   - Traceroute


✅ Step 7: Save Output to a File
    Store your scan results using:

            nmap -sV <target_ip> -oN scan_results.txt

✅ Step 8: Open and Review Saved Output
View the output using:    

            cat scan_results.txt

✅ Step 9: Interpret the Results
    Review the findings:
- Identify open ports (e.g., 22 for SSH, 80 for HTTP)
 - Understand the services and their versions
 - Use online resources to search for known vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE database)

## 📌 Important Notes:

- Always scan systems that you own or have explicit permission to scan.
- Nmap is a reconnaissance tool—it does not exploit vulnerabilities.
- For more advanced vulnerability analysis, tools like OpenVAS or Nessus can be used alongside Nmap.

## ✅ Conclusion:
In this task, we explored how to use Nmap to perform a basic vulnerability scan on a system. By identifying open ports and the services running on them, we gained valuable insights into the system's exposure and potential security gaps. This foundational skill is essential for ethical hackers, system administrators, and cybersecurity professionals to perform regular assessments and harden their systems against attacks.
